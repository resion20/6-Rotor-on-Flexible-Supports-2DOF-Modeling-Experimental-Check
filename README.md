# 6-Rotor-on-Flexible-Supports-2DOF-Modeling-Experimental-Check
This work modeled a rotor assembly (shaft + three rods) mounted on flexible supports as a two-degree-of-freedom system—one translational and one rotational—to study its small-oscillation dynamics and validate theory against experiment.
